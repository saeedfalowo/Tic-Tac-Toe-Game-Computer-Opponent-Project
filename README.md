# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Computer-Opponent-Project

I decided to take on a C++ Tic Tac Toe Game project in other to learn C++. I found a Tic Tac Toe Project that can be played between two people (ref: http://www.cppforschool.com/project/tic-tac-toe-project.html).

However, staying away from other humans seems to be the trend these days, #covid19, so I decided to build a computer opponent for me to play against. How did I manage to build a computer opponent with no prior knowledge of coding with C++? Just google it! As long as you have an idea of what you want to accomplish and the steps you need to take to complete those tasks, google will refer you to locations with resources on how to implement your thought processes using your chosen programming language.

The computer was designed to: 

- Always monitor the human opponent's moves and possible winning routes/paths.
- It will then place its moves in an attempt to win while also blocking the human opponent's winning routes.
- If the human opponent is one move away from winning, it will prioritise blocking the opponent over winning the game.
- It will rather draw the game than lose.
